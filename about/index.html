I am a CS student at University of Basilicata in Italy, I&rsquo;m very passionate about all things computer science, but also music (can you guess my favorite artist? look at the website&rsquo;s subtitle), movies, tv shows and motorsports.
I decided to create this blog for many reasons, I wanted to have a place to store some of my notes, but also to try and help people that want to learn more about CS by trying to unpack the more complex topics.

<p>Hi! My name is Enrico and welcome to my website!</p>
<p>I am a CS student at University of Basilicata in Italy, I&rsquo;m very passionate about all things computer science, but also music (can you guess my favorite artist? look at the website&rsquo;s subtitle), movies, tv shows and motorsports.</p>
<p>I decided to create this blog for many reasons, I wanted to have a place to store some of my notes, but also to try and help people that want to learn more about CS by trying to unpack the more complex topics.</p>
<p>On this website I will also try and diversify the content of the articles by writing short essays about other topics unrelated to CS.</p>
<p>I hope you will find my content useful or interesting!</p>
