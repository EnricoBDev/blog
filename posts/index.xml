      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Enrico and welcome to my website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a CS student at University of Basilicata in Italy, I&amp;rsquo;m very passionate about all things computer science, but also music (can you guess my favorite artist? look at the website&amp;rsquo;s subtitle), movies, tv shows and motorsports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to create this blog for many reasons, I wanted to have a place to store some of my notes, but also to try and help people that want to learn more about CS by trying to unpack the more complex topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Enrico and welcome to my website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a CS student at University of Basilicata in Italy, I&amp;rsquo;m very passionate about all things computer science, but also music (can you guess my favorite artist? look at the website&amp;rsquo;s subtitle), movies, tv shows and motorsports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to create this blog for many reasons, I wanted to have a place to store some of my notes, but also to try and help people that want to learn more about CS by trying to unpack the more complex topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this website I will also try and diversify the content of the articles by writing short essays about other topics unrelated to CS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will find my content useful or interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
