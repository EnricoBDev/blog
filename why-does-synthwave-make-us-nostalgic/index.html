<p>Before diving in our &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;, I wanted to tell you how this article came to life&hellip;</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was cramming for my computer architecture exam and I wanted some kind of background music that was not too distracting, you might say the obvious pick would be some lo-fi hip-hop radio playlist but for me it&rsquo;s way too chill and relaxing (not ideal when you are sleep deprived), so I decided to pick <a href="https://youtu.be/k3WkJq478To?si=PDCGq3v1dNHtLr5G">this</a> synthwave playlist that I used to listen to and after a few songs an inexplicable wave of nostalgia and melanchony hit me, that&rsquo;s when I started to search why is this genre so nostalgic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-synthwave">What is synthwave?<a href="#what-is-synthwave" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Despite being heavily inspired by the 80s, synthwave is a relatively new genre, it was born from the minds of artists from the French electronic scene in the late 2000s, as the name suggests the genre is centered around the heavy use of analog synths and usually has a quite energetic rhythm, it is also quite similar to French house music (the only good thing France created \s) and Italo disco (the great Giorgio Moroder is one of the fathers of electronic music, which synthwave is a subgenre of)</p>
<h2 id="synthwave-in-pop-culture">Synthwave in pop culture<a href="#synthwave-in-pop-culture" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>One of the things that brought synthwave to the mainstream was the movie Drive (Ryan Gosling is literally me), and its soundtrack featuring &ldquo;Kavinsky&rdquo;’s famous &ldquo;Nightcall&rdquo; and &ldquo;College&rdquo;’s &ldquo;A Real Hero&rdquo;, the film’s theme song</p>
<p>Another very important movie that is associated with synthwave is Blade Runner 2049, but in this case I think that people associate this movie more with the visual aesthetic of synthwave rather than the music.</p>
<h2 id="the-visual-aesthetic">The visual aesthetic<a href="#the-visual-aesthetic" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you have all seen some pictures (like the one on header of this article) that follow the synthwave aesthetic, they all have something in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>bright purple neon lights</li>
<li>futuristic cars and wirefame graphics</li>
<li>sunsets (a lot of sunsets)</li>
<li>infinite landscapes (like tall skyscraper but also mountain terrains)</li>
</ul>
<p>And I think that the visuals also contribute to the general nostalgia feeling, for me it&rsquo;s mostly the sunsets but also the infinite landscapes, they are mostly empty, there isn&rsquo;t a single person and it gives off the same vibe as a liminal space.</p>
<h2 id="nostalgia-for-something-i-never-lived">Nostalgia for something I never lived<a href="#nostalgia-for-something-i-never-lived" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now try and understand where this nostalgia stems from&hellip;</p>
<p>As I said this music is heavily inspired from the 80s but there is a problem, I was born in the 2000s, how can I feel nostalgic about it?</p>
<p>The thing is I have only consumed media from the 80s sporadically and I really don&rsquo;t know much about that time period so really there has to be another reason why this music makes me nostalgic&hellip;</p>
<p>So the only things that I think can explain this nostalgic feeling are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the use of warm sounding analog synths and recording equipment, along with other effects create a kind of &ldquo;past memory effect&rdquo;, they make the music seem like a past memory, fuzzy and not quite clear</li>
<li>specific chord progressions that trigger this melanchony, I know that specific chords and keys can be used to bring a certain feeling to the listener but there are a couple of problems:
<ul>
<li>first of all there are countless synthwave songs and they all use different keys</li>
<li>then since it is electronic music, traditional chord progressions and rhythmic patterns are not always followed</li>
<li>even if a song uses particular chord progressions I have not found any specific chord that brings this sense of nostalgia, so this is a dead end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be frank with you, I have no idea why this music brings me this melancholy and nostalgia for the good times (in my case the 2010s), and I really hope to find an answer to this someday.</p>
<p>In the end, synthwave is not just a genre, it&rsquo;s a time machine. Whether it takes us to the 80s or to a more recent past, if we bring its glorious synth melodies and funky rhythm close to our heart it will remind us that past memories are still with us, and that the good times we miss and cherish so much are yet to come.</p>
